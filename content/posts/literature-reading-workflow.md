this setup is the synced to all my devices meaning that these annotations are present on my laptop. When opening the paper on my laptop three main windows are opended, the first is a zathura instance of the paper opened to the last viewed page (left pane), the bibtex information is then opened (top-right pane) and finally an LLM chat is opened with the content of the paper already prepared in a prompt for asking quick queries.
